## Comments

> The following snippet shows the different ways you can write comments in Swift.

```swift
// Single line comment
/*
    Multi
    Line
    Comment
*/
```

## Operators

> The following snippet shows the different arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators used in Swift.

```swift
+ // Addition

- // Subtraction

* // Multiplication

/ // Division

% // Modulus

++ // Increment (by 1)

-- // Decrement (by 1)

== // Equal to

!= // Not equal to

< // Less than

> // Greater than

>= // Greater than or equal to

<= // Less than or equal to

&& // Logical and

|| // Logical or

! // Logical not
```

## Variables

> The following snippet shows the different data types in C++, as well as how to initialize and set variables.

```swift
// Constant variables: these get set once and cannot be reassigned later on.

let double : Double = 10.0;
let int = 1; // Swift can infer that this is an integer

// Regular variables: you can reassign these at any point in the code, after they are initialized.

var integer : Int = 2;
var amITired = true;
integer = 3; // reassignment
```

## Statements

> The following snippet gives examples of common logical statements.

```swift

```

## Preprocessor Directives

> The following snippet shows different preprocessor directives that can be used in Swift. These are lines included in a program that begin with the character #, which make them different from a typical source code text. They are invoked by the compiler to process some programs before compilation.

```swift

```

## Classes & Functions

> The following snippet shows how to create a class in Swift.

``` swift
